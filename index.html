    <h1>A Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</h1>
    <p><em>This JavaScript activity was adapted originally from our previous code solution for the same game name. I added my personal flavor by using HP (hit points) system just like what we see in games, instead of the usual raise to nth or something similar. I started with the logic part, but hopefully I'll be able to add decent visuals to it after applying HTML and CSS. Stay tuned!</em></p>
